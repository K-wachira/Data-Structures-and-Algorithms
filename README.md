## About

Data-Structures-and-Algorithms 

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. 

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

On this repo you will find questions with difficulty levels ranging from Easy to hard and covering categories such as Search, Sort, Insert, Update, Delete e.t.c

**Strictly for educational purposes only**
