# Note

Prims algorithm is a greedy algorithm and that means that time and space complexity grow at a high rate as the input grows, which is not a good property for an algorithm.


It is a greedy algo because :
``` 
   List of edges has to be searched from beginning as new edge gets added.

    If there are more than one edges having same weight then all possible spanning trees are required to be found for final minimal tree.
```

# Test case 1


## input graph =  [[0, 0], [2, 2], [3, 10], [5, 2], [7, 0]]
## Expected output = 20
