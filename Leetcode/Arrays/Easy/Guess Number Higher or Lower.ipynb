    "We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:\n",

    "I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).\n",
    "* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).\n",
    "* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).\n",
